 ### Table of Contents
 
-   We have divided each sub task into folders containing seperate codebase(.ipynb) and generated their PDFs. Each PDF/codebase is self explanatory and talk about different results and inferences, added in between the code and in the end.
-   For exploratory part, we look at the Flights dataset containing information about delays, cancellation and on-time flights during covid years. We look at how covid affect flights in a region. 
-   We also look into the how of an event like state of emergency announcement had an impact on covid.
-   Following are the contents of the repository:
    
    1. **/covid_dataset** - contains the assigned states dataset and stores dataframes after initial cleaning.
    
    [Mandatory task -1]
    
    2. **/cleaning** - contains cleaning.ipynb codebase for task 1 of the assignment.
    
    [Mandatory tasks -2]
    
    3. **/part_a** - contains code and anaylsis for task 2a of the assignment.
    4. **/part_b** - contains code and anaylsis for task 2b of the assignment.
    5. **/part_c** - contains code and anaylsis for task 2c of the assignment.
    6. **/part_d** - contains code and anaylsis for task 2d of the assignment.
    7. **/part_e** - contains code and anaylsis for task 2e of the assignment.
    
    [Exploratory tasks]
    
    8. **/Exploratory** - contains code, FLIGHT dataset and different inference anaylsis for the exploratory part of the assignment.


Note: Raw Flight Dataset for 2020 was very large and cannot be uploaded. But we have the dataset after extracting the essential features used for our anaylsis.  DatasetX link - https://www.transtats.bts.gov/OT_Delay/OT_DelayCause1.asp
